    "text": "The Bias in healthcare studies\nWhen practicing evidence-based medicine, medical doctors and healthcare researchers often on data analysis to make informed decisions. However, one of the biggest challenges in research is bias—systematic errors that can distort findings and lead to incorrect conclusions.\nSince then many choices in medical practice are made from fresh research papers it’s better to be well trained on get the idea of bias.\nHere the main types of bias healthcare are explained with some examples, and offers strategies to reduce them. Bias in research can occur at various stages from study design to data collection and publication.\nSo, let’s find the bias when working in data analytics for evidence-Based Medicine.\n\n\nType of Bias:\n\nSelection Bias\n\nSelection bias occurs when the participants included in a study are not representative of the target population. This often happens when the selection process is influenced by factors that are related to the outcome of interest.\nExample: A clinical trial on a new hypertension drug recruits only younger, healthier patients, excluding older adults with comorbidities. The results may show the drug is effective, but this might not hold true for the broader population.\nWhy It Matters: Selection bias can limit the generalizability of study findings, making it hard to apply results to real-world clinical practice.\n\nObservation Bias\n\nObservation bias arises when there are errors in measuring exposure, outcomes, or other variables due to the way data is collected.\nExample: In a study comparing pain levels after two types of surgeries, patients in one group know they received the “innovative” surgery and report lower pain levels because they expect better outcomes. This is an example of performance bias, a subtype of observation bias.\nWhy It Matters: Observation bias can artificially inflate or deflate the apparent effectiveness of an intervention.\n\nPublication Bias\n\nPublication bias occurs when studies with significant or “positive” results are more likely to be published than studies with “negative” or null results.\nExample: A pharmaceutical company sponsors ten trials for a new antidepressant. Only the three trials showing significant improvements are published, while the seven with no benefit are ignored. This creates a skewed perception of the drug’s effectiveness.\nWhy It Matters: Clinicians and researchers rely on published literature. If only favorable studies are accessible, it may lead to overestimation of treatment benefits.\n\nConfirmation Bias\n\nConfirmation bias occurs when researchers unconsciously interpret or highlight data in ways that support their hypothesis.\nExample: A researcher studying the benefits of a specific diet for diabetes patients may focus on data points that show improvements while ignoring data showing no change or worsening outcomes.\nWhy It Matters: Confirmation bias can undermine the objectivity of scientific inquiry and mislead clinical decision-making.\n\nAttrition Bias\n\nAttrition bias happens when participants drop out of a study in a way that is related to the exposure or outcome.\nExample: In a weight loss study, participants who struggle to lose weight are more likely to drop out. The final results may exaggerate the effectiveness of the program because only those who succeeded remain.\nWhy It Matters: Attrition bias can distort findings, particularly in long-term studies.\n\n\nHow to Reduce Bias?\nReducing bias is critical to ensure the validity and reliability of research findings. Here are some strategies:\n\nRandomization\n\nRandomization ensures that participants are assigned to groups purely by chance. This minimizes selection bias and balances known and unknown confounding factors between groups.\nExample: In a randomized controlled trial for a new vaccine, participants are randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine or a placebo.\n\nBlinding\n\nBlinding prevents participants, researchers, or both from knowing which intervention has been assigned, reducing observation bias.\n\nSingle-blind: The participants are unaware of their group allocation.\nDouble-blind: Both participants and researchers are unaware of group allocation.\n\nExample: In a drug trial, neither the patients nor the clinicians administering the medication know who receives the active drug versus the placebo.\n\nPre-Registration of Study Protocols\n\nResearchers can pre-register their study design, hypotheses, and planned analyses in databases like ClinicalTrials.gov. This reduces the risk of selective reporting and confirmation bias.\nExample: By pre-registering, a researcher commits to publishing the findings, whether the results are significant or not.\n\nIntention-to-Treat Analysis\n\nThis approach analyzes participants based on the group to which they were originally assigned, regardless of whether they completed the intervention as planned. It helps address attrition bias.\nExample: In a diabetes drug trial, a patient who stops taking the drug halfway through is still included in the final analysis.\n\nSystematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\n\nSystematic reviews and meta-analyses combine results from multiple studies, helping to counteract publication bias by including both published and unpublished data.\nExample: A systematic review of antidepressant trials includes data from pharmaceutical companies that were not published in journals.\n\nTransparent Reporting\n\nAdhering to reporting guidelines, such as CONSORT for clinical trials or PRISMA for systematic reviews, ensures all relevant details are disclosed.\nExample: A clinical trial includes detailed information about randomization, blinding, and attrition rates in its published report.\n\nIndependent Replication\n\nEncouraging independent replication of studies helps verify findings and reduce the influence of biases in individual studies.\nExample: If multiple independent studies show the same results for a new cancer treatment, confidence in its effectiveness increases.\nWhat’s to do now?\nBias is a common but manageable challenge in evidence-based medicine. By understanding the different types of bias such as: selection, observation, publication, confirmation, and attrition biases and employing strategies like: randomization, blinding, and transparent reporting. Healthcare researcher can now critically appraise research and make better clinical decisions. Reducing bias not only strengthens the validity of studies but also ensures that patients receive the best possible care based on reliable evidence.\nMaterial to go even deeper on the topic:\n\nHiggins JPT, Green S.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Is tech improving our healthcare journey?\nThe integration of digital technologies in healthcare is an evolutionary process, marked by both advancements and initial challenges. While the introduction of new technologies can lead to temporary setbacks and integration hurdles, the healthcare sector is currently experiencing a transformative period where data and technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) are converging to enhance processes, capabilities, and, most importantly, patient care. The following outlines some significant shifts occurring in healthcare delivery and medication management within complex supply chains and hospital systems.\nFrom Basic Automation to Intelligent and Adaptive Assistance:\nThe 21st century has witnessed a surge in the adoption of automation in healthcare. However, early automation systems presented their own set of difficulties. While hospital pharmacies have realized certain efficiencies, these technologies have also introduced challenges, such as information overload.\nMany communication systems, designed with good intentions, may have been implemented without a comprehensive understanding of hospital workflows. This has resulted in excessive and often unnecessary communication, contributing to staff burnout, particularly in pharmacy settings where personnel are bombarded with irrelevant or low-value notifications. Consequently, there’s a critical need for more user-centric and adaptive systems.\nAI is paving the way for such systems, enabling greater customization based on individual user needs. Instead of being designed solely around a tool’s capabilities, features and notifications can be tailored to specific user requirements. This represents a significant advancement in hospital-based digital transformation, shifting the focus from simply having information available to optimizing how that information is accessed and utilized.\nThe importance of this customization becomes clear when considering the complex tasks healthcare professionals perform. For instance, an anesthesiologist in the operating room might be managing numerous concurrent tasks, including monitoring patient vitals, interacting with electronic health records (EHRs), and tracking medication administration. Currently, this information often originates from disparate sources. The goal is to consolidate and deliver this information to providers in a timely and relevant manner. The future envisions technology as an extension of the provider, potentially through innovations like virtual and augmented reality, providing real-time access to crucial information.\nEnhancing Supply Chain Management through Predictive Analytics and Collaboration:\nEffective pharmaceutical forecasting and management are essential for both operational efficiency and patient well-being. However, maintaining a balance between overstocking and stockouts can be challenging.\nDrug shortages remain a persistent problem in healthcare. Conversely, excessive stockpiling can lead to waste through expiration or unnecessary inventory costs. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for supply chain optimization. Centralizing data by integrating technologies across health systems creates a unified data repository. This repository provides real-time visibility into inventory, usage trends, expirations, recalls, and other critical data points.\nBy leveraging this comprehensive data, ML algorithms can generate analytical insights and predictive models to anticipate future needs and optimize ordering processes. This allows for more efficient distribution of pharmaceuticals within hospital systems, freeing pharmacists to focus on patient care.\nFurthermore, cloud-based technologies facilitate inter-hospital collaboration. Moving away from siloed data centers enables greater data sharing and transparency. This is particularly beneficial for managing pharmaceutical supply chains, which can be unpredictable. Shared visibility can mitigate the risk of hoarding and ensure that critical therapies are available where they are needed most, especially during shortages or emergencies.\nPrioritizing Ethical and Secure Transformation:\nAs hospitals embrace digital transformation, cybersecurity must be a paramount concern. Protecting sensitive patient information and ensuring the reliability and integrity of technology are crucial. Given the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, including AI-driven attacks, hospitals must be vigilant in vetting software and vendors, both new and existing. Legacy systems, often overlooked, also require thorough scrutiny.\nBeyond technology assessment, establishing robust cybersecurity governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) programs and hiring qualified personnel are essential. All vendors should adhere to strict compliance standards.\nWhen implemented thoughtfully and securely, digital transformation can enhance operational efficiency, reduce staff burden, and improve patient care. Ultimately, the greatest success will be measured by the positive impact on the patient experience."

This methodology offers a transformative perspective, presenting scientists with creative experimental directions that may otherwise have gone unexplored. Essentially, GPT-4b Micro serves as a virtual architect for protein innovation.\nPromising Early Results\nInitial experiments with GPT-4b Micro have shown encouraging outcomes. Protein variants suggested by the AI have outperformed those designed by human researchers, with some achieving performance improvements of up to 50-fold for specific proteins. While these findings are promising, they require further validation through rigorous testing and peer-reviewed studies.\nShould these results withstand scrutiny, they could represent a major leap forward in longevity science. Enhanced proteins capable of rejuvenating cells may significantly extend human life and healthspan, aligning with Retro Biosciences’ mission to leverage AI in the fight against aging.\nWhy It Matters\nThis development highlights the transformative potential of AI in accelerating discoveries in biology and medicine. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has expressed optimism about AI’s ability to drive scientific progress, and GPT-4b Micro exemplifies this vision by contributing to advancements in longevity research.\nNotably, Sam Altman has personally invested $180 million in Retro Biosciences, underscoring the growing interest and importance of this field. The collaboration between AI and biotechnology represents an exciting frontier in addressing humanity’s grand challenges, with profound implications for aging populations and global health.\nLooking Ahead\nDespite the promising early results, the journey to fully validate and refine GPT-4b Micro’s protein designs remains complex. However, the partnership between OpenAI and Retro Biosciences sets a precedent for integrating AI with biological research to tackle age-related challenges. By combining computational power with scientific inquiry, they are advancing efforts to extend human lifespans and improve the quality of life on an unprecedented scale.\nAs AI continues to revolutionize biological sciences, it is clear that these technologies will play an increasingly critical role in addressing some of humanity’s most pressing issues. While the ultimate impact of GPT-4b Micro on longevity research is yet to be determined, the collaboration between OpenAI and Retro Biosciences marks an important step toward a future where AI-driven solutions reshape our understanding of aging and health."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Bitcoin era\nDifferent medical practices experience varying degrees of benefit from cryptocurrency adoption. Practices that primarily operate on a cash basis, such as outpatient clinics and those offering concierge or direct primary care (where patients pay a recurring fee for enhanced access), can enhance their modern image by accepting cryptocurrency. The growing field of medical tourism also stands to gain. For patients traveling from countries with unstable local currencies or unfavorable exchange rates, cryptocurrency offers a potentially stable and convenient alternative. For example, in El Salvador, Bitcoin is legal tender, and in Argentina, where inflation is high and dollar exchange rates fluctuate significantly, cryptocurrency can provide a way to navigate financial uncertainty.\nWhile credit cards are popular for their convenience, their transaction fees (typically 3-5%) can significantly impact a practice’s revenue. Cryptocurrency payment gateways, however, often have much lower fees, sometimes as low as 0.5%. In the context of rising inflation and shrinking profit margins in healthcare, this difference can be crucial for maintaining profitability.\nThe potential of smart contracts, self-executing agreements coded on the blockchain, is a key aspect of this technology. These contracts automate transactions and reduce the need for intermediaries. In healthcare, they could streamline billing by releasing payments automatically upon service completion, such as after a telemedicine appointment, saving time and minimizing disputes.\nSmart contracts can also improve regulatory compliance by embedding legal requirements directly into transactions, enhancing security and trust. While implementation requires technical expertise, the resulting transparency and efficiency can be valuable. For practices using cryptocurrency, smart contracts offer additional innovation and functionality.\nDirect cryptocurrency transfers between patient and practice wallets, while technically possible and fee-free, are prone to errors and generally not recommended. Instead, practices should use cryptocurrency payment gateways. These platforms, similar to credit card processors, bridge the gap between patient wallets and the practice’s bank account, adding security layers. These gateways often mitigate price volatility by locking in exchange rates for a short period during transactions.\nUpon receiving payment, the practice can choose to retain the cryptocurrency or convert it to traditional currency. Various gateways exist, each with different fees and supported cryptocurrencies. Some offer reduced or waived fees for premium memberships, which may be beneficial for practices with high cryptocurrency transaction volumes.\nTo begin accepting cryptocurrency, a practice can:\nCreate an account on a reputable and regulated cryptocurrency exchange (e.g., Coinbase, Binance). Integrate the chosen platform with their website or provide in-office QR codes for payments. Decide whether to hold cryptocurrency or convert it to traditional currency. Train staff to manage transactions and monitor payments using the platform’s interface. Many gateways, including Coinbase and PayPal, offer user-friendly app-based payment options.\nWhen choosing which cryptocurrencies to accept, it’s important to be aware of the risks, including the prevalence of fraudulent or unstable currencies. Starting with Bitcoin (BTC), the most widely accepted cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization, is advisable. Another option is USD Coin (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, which simplifies conversion to traditional currency.\nEven major cryptocurrencies can fluctuate significantly in value. This can lead to patient dissatisfaction if the value changes substantially after a transaction. Therefore, obtaining informed consent from patients before accepting cryptocurrency payments and clearly explaining the potential for price volatility is crucial. It’s important to acknowledge that price fluctuations could benefit or disadvantage the patient.\nWhile cryptocurrency offers a promising payment option for healthcare, it’s unlikely to completely replace traditional methods. Practices should maintain their existing payment infrastructure. Further research is needed to determine the prevalence of cryptocurrency use in healthcare transactions.\nCryptocurrency represents a potential evolution in healthcare finance. By adopting this technology, practices can modernize, potentially improve patient satisfaction, and streamline operations. Whether a practice is cash-based and seeking cost reductions or a medical tourism provider aiming to expand its reach, cryptocurrency offers potential benefits. A measured approach, continuous learning, and adaptability are key as this technology continues to develop."

Hence the opportunity here of GenAI is just to manage exactly all the jobs that as healthcare professional you try to avoid every day to let you as much time as possible with patients. This since GenAI can empower your role, plus the patients to take a more active role in their healthcare. This since patients can use LLM-powered chatbots to interact with their EHR, prepare for appointments.\nWhile challenges exist, the benefits of GenAI are too significant to ignore, and it may revolutionize care delivery by automating tasks, improving patient self-management, and enhancing job satisfaction.\nBy actively engaging in the development and implementation of GenAI, and adopting a balanced approach that prioritizes safety and responsibility, we can explore its potential to transform the way we deliver cardiovascular care and ultimately improve patient outcomes."

The 0.95-millimeter robot is 60% smaller than current endoscopic robots and is made of a hollow skeleton, optical fibers, functionalized skin, and a gel-like coating.The researchers say it achieves the “impossible trinity” of combining imaging, precise movement, and multiple functions. Their findings were published in Nature Communications.\nThe study showed the robot significantly expands the imaging area (25 times the normal view) and can detect obstacles up to 9.4 mm away (10 times the theoretical limit). It’s capable of sampling, drug delivery, and laser ablation, and navigated smoothly through in vitro bronchial models and ex-vivo pig lungs.\nProfessor Shen Yajing, who led the research team, explained that while small robots have potential for diagnosis and treatment, current models lack compactness, precise navigation, and diverse functions. Their work aims to solve these problems. Prof. Shen believes this robot could be a major step forward in clinical surgical robots, enabling early diagnosis and treatment in difficult-to-reach areas of the body, with broad biomedical applications. The team plans to conduct in vivo trials next.\nThe Asia-Pacific region is seeing increased investment in healthcare robotsics, especially for surgery and rehabilitation. For instance, Bangkok Hospital is investing $5 million in a robotic surgery center. The University of Hong Kong is using robot-assisted spine surgery. Chinese and South Korean wearable rehabilitation robots are now available in the US and Australia. In addition, even happening in Asia area, a Chinese team recently created a small, highly sensitive biosensor for continuous glucose monitoring."

    "text": "Survival analysis\nIf you’re new to the world of medical research, you may have heard the term “survival analysis” thrown around and thought, “Sounds serious… is this about my career?” Don’t worry—it’s not (we hope!). Survival analysis is a statistical tool used to analyze time-to-event data, and it’s incredibly useful for understanding outcomes in medicine. Let’s break it down, step by step, with some examples.\nIn a nutshell, survival analysis answers questions like:\n\nHow long does it take for an event to occur?\nWhat factors influence the timing of that event?\n\nHere, the “event” could be a positive outcome (like recovery or a sneeze) or a less-than-ideal one (like disease progression or mortality). The key difference between survival analysis and other data analysis techniques is its ability to handle censored data. Censoring happens when you don’t observe the event during the study period—for example, a patient hasn’t died or relapsed by the time the study ends.\nFun Fact: Survival analysis isn’t just for medicine! It’s also used in engineering (how long before a machine breaks) and business (how long a customer stays loyal to a subscription). But in medicine, it’s a literal life-saver.\nCommon solution that Survival Analysis can gave us:\n\nCancer Treatment Trials\n\nImagine you’re testing a new chemotherapy drug. You want to know how long patients survive after starting treatment. Some patients may still be alive when the study ends, so you’ll have censored data. Survival analysis lets you account for this.\n\nOrgan Transplant Studies\n\nYou’re studying how long kidney transplants last before organ failure occurs. Here, time-to-event data (time until organ failure) is crucial to evaluating the success of different transplant techniques.\n\nTime to Readmission\n\nIf you’re analyzing how long patients stay out of the hospital after discharge, survival analysis helps identify risk factors for readmission and assess interventions to reduce it.\nCommon Survival Models (Pick Your Poison, Statistically Speaking)\n\nKaplan-Meier Curves\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier method is like the “intro course” to survival analysis. It estimates survival probabilities over time and creates a curve showing the proportion of patients surviving at different time points.\nWhy Use It?\n\nSimple and visual.\nGreat for comparing survival between groups (e.g., drug vs. placebo).\n\nExample: You’re evaluating survival after heart surgery in two groups: those who received a new device vs. standard care. Kaplan-Meier gives you a clear picture of how survival curves differ.\n\nCox Proportional Hazards Model\n\nThe Cox model takes survival analysis to the next level. It examines the relationship between survival time and multiple predictors (like age, smoking status, or treatment type). It’s called “proportional hazards” because it assumes the effect of predictors remains constant over time.\nWhy Use It?\n\nAdjusts for confounding variables.\nHelps identify which factors significantly impact survival.\n\nExample: In a cancer trial, the Cox model might reveal that tumor size and age significantly influence survival, while gender does not.\n\nParametric Models\n\nUnlike the Cox model, parametric models assume a specific distribution (e.g., exponential, Weibull) for survival times. These are great when you’re interested in modeling the actual shape of the survival curve.\nWhy Use It?\n\nMore informative when you can justify the assumptions.\nUseful for making predictions.\n\nExample: You’re studying time until remission in a chronic disease. A parametric model lets you estimate not just median survival but also probabilities at specific time points.\n\nCompeting Risks Models\n\nSometimes, patients can experience more than one type of event, and these events compete. For example, in a study on cancer patients, death from heart disease is a competing risk for death from cancer.\nWhy Use It?\n\nAccounts for competing risks, avoiding biased results.\n\nExample: You’re analyzing time to disease recurrence, but some patients die before recurrence occurs. Ignoring this competing risk would overestimate the recurrence risk.\nCommon Pitfalls when dealing with survival analysis (And How to Avoid Them)\n\nIgnoring Censoring\n\nCensoring is a cornerstone of survival analysis. Ignoring it is like ignoring patients who didn’t show up for their final follow-up—a big statistical no-no.\nPro Tip: Always check that your survival model properly accounts for censored data.\n\nOverfitting\n\nUsing too many variables in your model can lead to overfitting, where the model fits the data too closely and performs poorly on new datasets.\nPro Tip: Be parsimonious with predictors. Use stepwise selection or shrinkage techniques to avoid this.\n\nAssuming Proportional Hazards\n\nThe Cox model assumes that the hazard ratios are constant over time. If this assumption is violated, your results might be misleading.\nPro Tip: Check proportionality with diagnostic plots or use time-varying covariates if needed.\nSo, let’s Wrap It Up (Like a Survival Blanket). Why is Survival Analysis Useful?\nHandles Censored Data: Not everyone experiences the event during the study period, but survival analysis doesn’t leave their data out of the equation. It’s like giving everyone a voice, even if they didn’t “finish the race”.\nFlexible Models: Survival analysis offers a variety of models to suit your needs (more on that in a moment).\nClinical Insights: It helps you understand which variables (age, treatment type, comorbidities) affect time to an event, aiding personalized medicine.\nReal-Life Applications: Whether you’re studying disease progression, treatment durability, or hospital outcomes, survival analysis has your back.\nSurvival analysis isn’t as intimidating as it sounds. It’s an essential tool for MDs diving into clinical research, helping you understand and predict time-to-event outcomes. Whether you’re drawing Kaplan-Meier curves or diving into the depths of the Cox model, remember: survival analysis is all about making the most of your data, even when life (or research) gets complicated.\nSo, the next time someone asks, “How long until the event occurs?” you can confidently say, “Let me run a survival analysis on that!” If they ask what that means, feel free to share this article — or just tell them it’s not about your career.

    "text": "Artificial intelligence is entering classrooms to teach medical oncology. Italy is leading the way with the first study of its kind, called “AI Learning,” which will assess how well medical students learn when taught by AI-powered avatars. This innovative teaching platform, developed by the start-up ctcHealth, is named Plato. It offers an immersive and personalized educational experience and was recently unveiled at the Italian Summit on Precision Medicine, an international event organized by the Foundation for Personalized Medicine (FMP) in Rome, attended by over 150 experts.\nThe complexity of current diagnostic and therapeutic pathways requires highly specialized and tailored training, explains Paolo Marchetti, president of FMP and scientific director at IDI-IRCCS in Rome. Over the past fifty years, traditional teaching methods have seen very few changes, evolving from overhead projectors to electronic slides but without any real transformation in teaching practices. Plato represents a true leap forward, integrating advanced technology with a more interactive and engaging educational approach.\nThe research project initially focuses on oncology but aims to expand into other fields of medicine. Giuseppe Curigliano, president-elect of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), professor of medical oncology at the University of Milan, and director of the Division for New Drug Development for Innovative Therapies at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO) in Milan, believes that Plato has the potential to revolutionize medical education. Developed by a team of experts in education and artificial intelligence, it marks an important Italian contribution to the global landscape of advanced educational technologies. Plato may also be used to train members of Molecular Tumor Boards, multidisciplinary teams that are key players in the evolving model of precision oncology. The system is capable of analyzing genomic profiling data along with clinical information derived from precision oncology research within these boards.\nThe AI Learning study, promoted by FMP and hosted at Sapienza University of Rome, will start in September 2025. It will involve around 120 medical students in the final two years of their program.\nDomenico Alvaro, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry at Sapienza University, emphasizes the institution’s strong commitment to experimenting with innovative teaching strategies to enhance the education of future healthcare professionals. In a time marked by the digital and technological transformation of health sciences, it is crucial to prepare highly skilled professionals in new technologies. The educational project coordinated by Professor Botticelli, along with several initiatives led by Professor Marchetti, perfectly fits into this vision."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Novo Nordisk, a global leader in diabetes and chronic disease care, has reimagined the way it creates clinical study reports, by using MongoDB Atlas together with Amazon Bedrock. Traditionally, compiling a clinical study reports took around 12 weeks and required collaboration across teams of statisticians, scientists, and technical writers. The process was slow and often delayed both regulatory approval and the delivery of new treatments to patients.\nIn 2023, Novo Nordisk introduced NovoScribe, a new platform that automates much of the CSR writing process. NovoScribe uses retrieval-augmented generation combined with large language models like Claude 3, Titan, and a private version of ChatGPT. MongoDB Atlas plays a central role by managing the structured data that powers the system. By integrating clinical trial data with smart templates, the platform helps the AI models produce complete and accurate reports in just 10 minutes.\nFrom such investments, Novo Nordisk has become the first pharmaceutical company to automate CSR generation at scale. Faster reporting not only helps the company accelerate regulatory submissions but also means patients can access new therapies more quickly. It is a major shift in how the pharmaceutical industry approaches reporting and data management.\nSource: https://www.mongodb.com/solutions/customer-case-studies/novo-nordisk"
