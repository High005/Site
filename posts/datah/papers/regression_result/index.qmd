# From Raw Output to Professional Tables: Transforming Statistical Results with gtsummary

In this article you'll see the way to communicate to your stakeholders the way to present the results in a clear, accessible format. 
The `gtsummary` package transform complex statistical output into publication-ready tables that speak to any audience.

## The Problem with Raw Statistical Output

Traditional R output, usually, presents several challenges when communicating with broader audiences:

### Issues with Base R Output:
- **Information overload**: Raw output includes MANY technical details (residuals, diagnostic statistics, model fit information) that can overwhelm your stakeholders
- **Poor formatting**: Console output lacks visual hierarchy and professional appearance
- **Technical jargon**: Terms like "Std. Error," "t value," and "Pr(>|t|)" require statistical background to interpret
- **Inconsistent presentation**: Different model types produce different output formats, making comparisons difficult

### Real-World Scenario:
Imagine presenting regression results from a clinical trial to a medical advisory board. Raw R output might show:
```
Coefficients:
                    Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)         45.2341     2.1234   21.29  < 2e-16 ***
treatment_group      8.7654     1.5678    5.59  8.9e-07 ***
age                  0.2345     0.0876    2.68   0.0089 ** 
gender_female       -2.1098     1.2345   -1.71   0.0912 .  
```

While statisticians can quickly interpret this, clinicians need to know: "What does this mean for patient outcomes?"

## What is gtsummary?

**gtsummary is an R package that creates elegant, publication-ready summary tables from statistical models.** It automatically formats results, adds appropriate labels, and presents findings in a way that's immediately interpretable by diverse audiences.

### Core Philosophy:
- **Clarity over complexity**: Present only the most relevant information
- **Audience-appropriate**: Adapt technical results for non-technical stakeholders
- **Professional appearance**: Generate tables ready for publications, presentations, and reports
- **Consistency**: Standardize output across different types of analyses

## Key Functions and Applications

### 1. tbl_regression(): The Workhorse Function

The `tbl_regression()` function transforms raw regression output into clean, interpretable tables.

**Key features:**
- Automatic formatting of coefficients and confidence intervals
- Clear variable labeling
- Optional p-values with appropriate formatting
- Customizable precision and display options

**Example transformation:**
Instead of raw coefficient output, you get a table showing:
- **Variable**: Treatment Group
- **Coefficient**: 8.77 (95% CI: 5.70, 11.84)
- **p-value**: <0.001

### 2. tbl_summary(): Descriptive Statistics Made Simple

Creates comprehensive descriptive statistics tables that are immediately publication-ready.

**Applications:**
- **Baseline characteristics**: Compare treatment groups in clinical trials
- **Population descriptions**: Summarize study participant characteristics
- **Stratified analyses**: Show results by subgroups

### 3. tbl_survfit(): Survival Analysis Results

Transforms complex survival analysis output into clear, interpretable tables showing:
- Median survival times with confidence intervals
- Survival probabilities at key time points
- Hazard ratios with clear interpretation

## Model Versatility: Beyond Linear Regression

### Supported Model Types:

**Linear Models:**
- Simple and multiple linear regression
- Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
- Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)

**Generalized Linear Models:**
- Logistic regression (odds ratios automatically calculated)
- Poisson regression (incidence rate ratios)
- Negative binomial regression

**Advanced Models:**
- Cox proportional hazards models
- Mixed-effects models (with appropriate packages)
- Bayesian models (with brms integration)

**Specialized Applications:**
- Dose-response analyses
- Propensity score matching results
- Meta-analysis summaries

### Example: Logistic Regression Output
Raw R output shows log-odds coefficients that are difficult to interpret:
```
Coefficients:
                Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)
treatment       1.2345     0.3456    3.57   0.0004
```

gtsummary automatically converts this to odds ratios:
- **Treatment**: OR = 3.44 (95% CI: 1.75, 6.77), p < 0.001

This immediately tells clinicians that treatment increases the odds of success by 244%.

## Customization for Different Audiences

### For Clinical Audiences:
- **Emphasize clinical significance**: Include effect sizes and confidence intervals
- **Plain language labels**: Replace variable names with descriptive text
- **Relevant precision**: Show appropriate decimal places for clinical context

### For Regulatory Submissions:
- **Complete statistical information**: Include all required statistics
- **Standardized formatting**: Follow regulatory guidelines for table presentation
- **Footnote integration**: Add necessary disclaimers and explanations

### For Executive Presentations:
- **Simplified display**: Focus on key results only
- **Visual emphasis**: Highlight significant findings
- **Context provision**: Include baseline comparisons

## Advanced Features

- **P-value formatting**: Control decimal places and significance indicators
- **Effect size measures**: Include standardized coefficients or effect sizes

### Visual Enhancement:
- **Conditional formatting**: Highlight significant results
- **Custom themes**: Match organizational branding
- **Integration capabilities**: Export to Word, HTML, or LaTeX

### Multi-table Integration:
- **Model comparison tables**: Compare multiple models side-by-side
- **Stratified analyses**: Present results by subgroups
- **Combined results**: Merge different types of analyses

## Best Practices for Implementation

### 1. Know Your Audience
- **Statistical background**: Adjust complexity accordingly
- **Domain expertise**: Use appropriate terminology
- **Decision-making needs**: Highlight actionable results

### 2. Table Design Principles
- **Logical organization**: Group related variables together
- **Clear headers**: Use descriptive column names
- **Appropriate precision**: Match decimal places to measurement precision
- **Consistent formatting**: Standardize across all tables

### 3. Interpretation Support

## Common Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Variable Labeling
**Problem**: R variable names (e.g., `trt_grp`, `age_yrs`) aren't presentation-ready
**Solution**: Use descriptive labels ("Treatment Group", "Age (years)")

### Challenge 2: Multiple Model Comparisons
**Problem**: Comparing results across different model types
**Solution**: Standardize presentation format across all models

### Challenge 3: Complex Interactions
**Problem**: Interaction terms are difficult to present clearly
**Solution**: Consider stratified analyses or graphical presentations alongside tables

## Key Takeaway

The transition from raw statistical output to professional presentation isn't just about aestheticsâ€”it's about effective scientific communication. Tools like `gtsummary` transform complex analyses into accessible insights, ensuring that statistical findings can inform decision-making at all levels. 

In an era where evidence-based decision making is crucial, the ability to communicate statistical results clearly and professionally has become as important as the analysis itself. By investing in proper presentation tools and techniques, researchers can maximize the impact of their work and ensure that valuable insights reach and influence their intended audiences.

**Remember**: Great statistics poorly communicated are far less valuable than good statistics clearly presented. The goal is not just to analyze data, but to transform that analysis into actionable knowledge.
